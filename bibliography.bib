	abstract="In traditional multi-commodity flow theory, the task is to send a  certain amount of each commodity from its start to its target node,  subject to capacity constraints on the edges.  However, no  restriction is imposed on the number of paths used for delivering  each commodity; it is thus feasible to spread the flow over a large  number of different paths.  Motivated by routing problems arising in  real-life applications, e.g., telecommunication, unsplittable  flows have moved into the focus of research.  Here, the demand of  each commodity may not be split but has to be sent along a single  path. In this paper a generalization of this problem is studied.  In the  considered flow model, a commodity can be split into a bounded  number of chunks which can then be routed on different paths.  In  contrast to classical (splittable) flows and unsplittable flows, the single-commodity case of this problem is  already  NP-hard and  even hard to approximate.  We present approximation algorithms for  the single- and multi-commodity case and point out strong  connections to unsplittable flows.  Moreover, results on the  hardness of approximation are presented.  In particular, we show  that some of our approximation results are in fact best possible,  unless P = NP.",
